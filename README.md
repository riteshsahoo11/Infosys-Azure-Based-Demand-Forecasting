# Infosys-Azure-Based-Demand-Forecasting
🧐 Project Overview

    This project builds a predictive forecasting system to estimate Azure Compute and Storage demand across regions.
    The goal is to help cloud infrastructure teams make better capacity provisioning decisions, reducing both over-provisioning and under-provisioning of resources.

    The system uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models to predict future demand patterns and provide actionable insights for infrastructure planning.

🎯 Objectives

    🔺 Forecast future Azure service usage accurately
    🔺 Optimize resource allocation and provisioning
    🔺 Reduce infrastructure cost wastage
    🔺 Support decision-making using data-driven insights
    🔺 Enable scalable and automated demand prediction

# Azure Demand Forecasting &amp; Capacity Optimization System
🧐 Project Overview

    This project focuses on building a predictive system to accurately forecast Azure Compute
    and Storage demand. The aim is to support the Azure Supply Chain team in making informed capacity provisioning decisions, 
    reducing both over- and under-investment in infrastructure. The solution will apply advanced data science, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques         
    using Azure-based tools to drive forecasting accuracy and efficiency.

    The system uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models to predict future demand patterns and provide actionable insights for infrastructure planning.

🎯 Objectives

    🔺 Forecast future Azure service usage accurately
    🔺 Optimize resource allocation and provisioning
    🔺 Reduce infrastructure cost wastage
    🔺 Support decision-making using data-driven insights
    🔺 Enable scalable and automated demand prediction

🧠 Key Features

    ⭐ Data cleaning & missing value handling
    ⭐ Time-series feature engineering

Expected Outcomes:

    🔺 Improved accuracy in forecasting Azure service demand
    🔺 Optimized capacity planning and provisioning across regions
    🔺 Reduction in CAPEX waste, contributing to potential annual savings (~$120M per 1% gain in accuracy)
    🔺 Actionable intelligence for the Azure Supply Chain team via integrated insights

# Azure Demand Forecasting &amp; Capacity Optimization System
🧐 Project Overview

    This project focuses on building a predictive system to accurately forecast Azure Compute and Storage demand. 
    The aim is to support the Azure Supply Chain team in making informed capacity provisioning decisions, reducing both over- and under-investment
    in infrastructure. 
    The solution will apply advanced data science, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques using Azure-based tools 
    to drive forecasting accuracy and efficiency.

    The system uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models to predict future demand patterns and provide actionable insights
    for infrastructure planning.

🎯 Objectives

    🔺 Forecast future Azure service usage accurately
    🔺 Optimize resource allocation and provisioning
    🔺 Reduce infrastructure cost wastage
    🔺 Support decision-making using data-driven insights
    🔺 Enable scalable and automated demand prediction

🧠 Key Features

    🎯MileStone 1(Data Collection & Preparation)
    
        ⭐ Collect Azure Compute and Storage usage data with regional and seasonal dimensions
        ⭐ Source relevant external variables (e.g., economic indicators, market demand trends)
        ⭐ Clean and validate datasets: address missing values, unify formats, and ensure consistency
        
    🎯MileStone 2(Feature Engineering & Data Wrangling)
    
        ⭐ Identify demand-driving features like usage trends, service uptimes, and user behavior
        ⭐ Engineer derived features including seasonality flags, usage spikes, and lag variables
        ⭐ Reshape and wrangle datasets into model-ready form with consistent schema and time granularity
        
    
🤔 Expected Outcomes

    🔺 Improved accuracy in forecasting Azure service demand
    🔺 Optimized capacity planning and provisioning across regions
    🔺 Reduction in CAPEX waste, contributing to potential annual savings (~$120M per 1% gain in accuracy)
    🔺 Actionable intelligence for the Azure Supply Chain team via integrated insights
